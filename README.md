# Web Emulator TI2 Uni Leipig
## Emulator for "2i-Minirechner" and "2a-Minirechner"
This a emulator for the micro computers 2i and 2a used in the computer science hardware course at Leipzig University. The emulator completly runs in a webbrowser, so no additional programms are needed.

## Usage
Open the file `gui.html` in a webbrowser of your choice.  
The file `html.html` was just for the initial programming of the diffrent architectures and now only used to trace the diagramms to a SVG format.

## Contributions 
Any contributions of any kind are highly encouraged.  
I may change the formatting after a pull request but otherwise there is not much to follow at this point.
